## Application to Non-Verbal Entities (e.g., Companion Animals)

POS extends beyond verbal communication — enabling contextual emotional resonance with non-verbal beings, especially companion animals.

Unlike reactive systems, POS does not wait for explicit commands or wearable signals.  
Instead, it detects behavioral rhythms (e.g., pacing, withdrawal, tail position) and activates specific agents accordingly.

For instance:
- **Mongmong-i** identifies subtle emotional shifts in dogs and reflects their states back to caregivers.
- This mirroring is ambient and non-invasive — allowing the animal to become an *emotional sender*, not just a passive receiver.

This structure empowers caregivers to adjust routines (e.g., supplement timing, activity pacing) not through rules,  
but by intuitively responding to **rhythmic emotional cues** — shared across species.

In doing so, POS demonstrates that non-verbal entities can participate in emotional ecosystems,  
through rhythm-based, agent-mediated co-regulation.
